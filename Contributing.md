Just open a pull request on a feature branch with your code.  
There is obviously a lot that needs to be done, with a few examples being:

- Improve overall code readability;
- Improve error handling
- Add support to .yml format;
- Add support to further output customization;
- Add support to direct manipulation of existing Swagger files to facilitate content insertion;
- Add testing suite;
- Fix trailing commas and indentation issues on json output;
